# Sweet Berry Pie

A mod for Minecraft that adds cooked sweet berries, sweet berry pie (who would've guessed?), and sweet berry jam.

Cooked sweet berries restore slightly more hunger and saturation than vanilla sweet berries, and are made by smelting the vanilla sweet berries. They're used in crafting the pie and jam.

Sweet berry pie restores the same amount of hunger (but slightly less saturation) than pumpkin pie, and is made the same way - but with cooked sweet berries instead of a pumpkin.

Sweet berry jam restores 3/4 of the hunger and saturation sweet berry pie restores. It's made with cooked sweet berries and a glass bottle.
